Predicting the future of text technologies by analyzing their past. [Learn more](https://stanford-cybertext.github.io/research/)

The CyberText Technologies Project catalogues the history of dominant text-based human communication devices in an effort to identify common traits. We use those traits to discover the patterns that can predict the future of modern-day technologies.

Which text technolgoes are going to succeed and how can they best be developed? The answer lies in the patterns of the past.
