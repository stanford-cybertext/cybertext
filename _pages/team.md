##### Elaine Treharne

Elaine Treharne is Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities at Stanford. In addition to serving as director of CESTA, she directs [Stanford Text Technologies](https://texttechnologies.stanford.edu/), an interdisciplinary program that draws upon both History of the Book and Digital Humanities to investigate the long history of 'text.' She is Principal Investigator of Stanford's contribution to the NEH-funded, multi-institutional project '[Global Currents: Cultures of Literary Networks, 1050-1900](https://globalcurrents.stanford.edu/)'. Professor Treharne is a keen advocate and critic of the use of digital technologies in the classroom; in addition to a seminar on the history of text technologies, she offers an online course, 'Digging Deeper,' that explores the creation and interpretation of manuscripts. Since 2015, she has served as co-director of the undergraduate Digital Humanities Minor.
