She is Principal Investigator of Stanford's contribution to the NEH-funded, multi-institutional project '[Global Currents: Cultures of Literary Networks, 1050-1900](https://globalcurrents.stanford.edu/)'. Professor Treharne is a keen advocate and critic of the use of digital technologies in the classroom; in addition to a seminar on the history of text technologies, she offers an online course, 'Digging Deeper,' that explores the creation and interpretation of manuscripts.
